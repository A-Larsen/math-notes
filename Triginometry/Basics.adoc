NOTE: Make sure calculator is in degrees to get the answer in degrees

NOTE: The inverse version of sine, cosine, and tangent have the "arc" prefix

In this video _d_ represents the line that is tangent to the circle. and the
tangent also represents that slope of the radius

====
radius: 2, tangent: 1
radius: 4, tangent: 1
radius: 5, tangent: 1

notice how the tangent is always one when you're at a 45 degree angle. No matter
what the radius

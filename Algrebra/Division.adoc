| 6	        | A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
| 7	        | To check divisibility by 7, double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7.
| 8	        | A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.

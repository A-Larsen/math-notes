== Rationalizing the denominator
Rationalizing is the process of multiplying a surd with another similar surd, to
result in a rational number. The surd that is used to multiply is called the
rationalizing factor (RF).

In math, a conjugate refers to a pair of binomials that have the same terms but
opposite signs between them.

Here we can multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the conjugate to
simplify the denomitor

\frac{10}{6+\sqrt{5}} * frac{6-\sqrt{5}}{6-\sqrt{5}} =
\frac{10(6-\sqrt{5})}{(6+\sqrt{5})(6-\sqrt{4})} =
\frac{10(6-\sqrt{5})}{36-\sqrt{25}} =
\frac{10(6-\sqrt{5})}{36-5} =
\frac{10(6-\sqrt{5})}{31}

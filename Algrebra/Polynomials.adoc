== Standard Form of a Polynomial
[stem]
++++
P(x) = a_{n}X^n + a_{n-1}X^(n-1) + a_{n-2}X^(n-2) + ... + a_{1}X + a_{0}
++++

[.item]#stem:[a_{n},a_{n-1},a_{n-2}]# are coefficients of 
[.item]#stem:[x^n,x^(n-1),x^(n-2)]#  and constant term respectively and it
should belong to real number (stem:[\exists\mathbb{R}])


== Factoring Trinomials
=== Leading Coeficient Of One
1. Find two numbers that when multiplied together equal the constant term
   but when added together equal the first degree term.

2. Take the two numbers from step one and put it in the multiplication of two
   binomials in the form of stem:[(x+a)(x+b)], where `a` is the first number
   number and `b` is the second term

Example:
[stem]
++++
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
++++

answer:: stem:[(x+3)(x+2)]

== Standard Form of a Polynomial
[stem]
++++
P(x) = a_{n}X^n + a_{n-1}X^(n-1) + a_{n-2}X^(n-2) + ... + a_{1}X + a_{0}
++++

[highlight]#stem:[a_{n},a_{n-1},a_{n-2}]# are coefficients of 
[highlight]#stem:[x^n,x^(n-1),x^(n-2)]#  and constant term respectively and it
should belong to real number (stem:[\exists\mathbb{R}]).

== Types of Polynomials
=== Binomials
[stem]
++++
ax^m+bx^n
++++

=== Standard Form of Quadradic Equation
[stem]
++++
ax^2 + bx + c
++++

== Factoring Trinomials
=== Leading Coeficient Of One
1. Find two numbers that when multiplied together equal the constant term
   but when added together equal the first degree term.

2. Take the two numbers from step one and put it in the multiplication of two
   binomials in the form of stem:[(x+a)(x+b)], where `a` is the first number
   number and `b` is the second term.

Example:
[stem]
++++
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
++++

answer:: stem:[(x+3)(x+2)]

=== Leading Coeficient Other Than One
1. Multiply the leading coeficient by the constant.

2. Find two numbers that when multiplied equal the number from step 1, but when
   added equals the first degree term.

3. Replace the first degree term with the two numbers from step 2 added
   together, and make sure they are multiplied by the same variable of the first
   degree term.

4. Factor until you get two binimals mulitiplied together

Example:
[stem]
++++
2x^2 - 3x - 2
++++

1. stem:[2 * -2 = 4]

2. stem:[-4 + 1 = -3\ and\ -4 * 1 = -4]

3. stem:[2x^2 - 4x + 1x -2]

4. stem:[2x(x-2) + 1(x - 2)] -> stem:[(x-2)(2x+1)]

== Quadradic Formula
[stem]
++++
x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
++++

== Discriminant
The part under the square root of the Quadradic Formula.

[stem]
++++
D = b^2-4ac
++++

stem:[D\gt0]:: 2 real solutions, factorable if perfect square
stem:[D=0]:: 1 real solution
stem:[D<0]:: 2 imaginary solutions

== Important Factoring
=== Difference of Squares
[stem]
++++
a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)
++++

=== Factoring Perfact cubes
[stem]
++++
A^3 + B^3 = (A+B)(A^2-AB+B^2)
++++

[stem]
++++
A^3 - B^3 = (A-B)(A^2+AB+B^2)
++++

== Standard Form to Vertex Form
1. Take the first degree term and take half of it squared added to both sides
2. factor

example:
[stem]
++++
y = x^2 + 6x - 5
++++

1. stem:[y+3^2=x^2+6x+3^2-5]
2. stem:[y + 9 = (x + 3)^2-5] -> -9 from both sides -> stem:[y=(x+3)^2-14]
